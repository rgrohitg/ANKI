_Goal Name:_ Technical Innovator

_Description:_ I am currently working on developing a cube semantic layer solution that will generalize the way we consume data for multiple BI and data distribution using GraphQL. My goals include:

- Designing and developing a scalable and flexible architecture
- Implementing a common service for data quality checks using SodaCL
- Ensuring flexibility for incorporating new changes and common use cases
- Improving data management efficiency and data quality
- Troubleshooting complex technical issues and pushing technological boundaries
- Delivering cutting-edge results that meet complex business needs

I aim to achieve these goals by leveraging my technical expertise, creative problem-solving skills, and strategic thinking.


### Goal: Ensure Code Quality and Security Through Daily Development and Reviews

**Description:**  
Develop secure and high-quality production code daily, focusing on implementing new features, fixing bugs, and optimizing existing functionality. Perform detailed code reviews for team members, providing constructive feedback to improve code quality, security, and performance. Debug and resolve issues in the codebase, ensuring stable and reliable software delivery. Actively participate in team discussions and collaborate on solutions to maintain and enhance coding standards and best practices.


### Goal: Drive Technical Evaluation and Integration of Advanced Solutions

**Description:**

I am leading evaluation sessions with external vendors, startups, and internal teams to assess architectural designs, technical credentials, and their applicability within our existing ecosystems and information architecture. Currently, I am evaluating a Cube semantic layer vendor to explore a semantic layer solution that could provide a single source of truth and advanced logical data modeling capabilities. Additionally, I am designing and coding SodaCL-based quality checks for the portal project to streamline and enhance our quality assurance process. This work ensures flexibility and scalability in our QA procedures and integrates seamlessly with our current infrastructure.

### Goal: Advance Technology Adoption and Best Practices in Software Engineering

**Description:**

I am leading communities of practice across software engineering to promote awareness and adoption of new and leading-edge technologies. This includes evaluating a Cube semantic layer vendor to provide a single source of truth and advanced logical data modeling capabilities, and designing and coding SodaCL-based quality checks for the portal project to streamline quality assurance processes. As an engineering lead, I also focus on implementing best practices to avoid code vulnerabilities and achieve high metrics in application health, ensuring robust and secure software solutions.
